# Week 01 – Array Operations

## Course
Data Structures

## Assignment Description
In this assignment, basic data structure operations are implemented on a static array using the C programming language. The program processes user input to perform operations on the array and automatically displays the updated state of the array after each operation.

## Implemented Operations
The program has a menu-driven structure and supports the following operations:

- **Insertion**: Inserts a new element at the index specified by the user. Existing elements are shifted to the right to preserve the array structure. After the insertion, the updated array is displayed.

- **Deletion**: Removes the element at the specified index from the array. Subsequent elements are shifted to the left. After the deletion, the updated array is displayed.

- **Reverse**: Reverses the order of elements in the array in-place and displays the result.

- **Display**: Displays the current contents of the array.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C  
- Data Structure: Static Array  
- Algorithms: Element Shifting and Swap Logic

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program:

```bash
gcc week1_array_operations.c -o week1
./week1
```

When the program runs, a menu is displayed. After each operation, the updated state of the array is automatically shown.
