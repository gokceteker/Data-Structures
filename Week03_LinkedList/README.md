## Course
Data Structures

## Assignment Description
This assignment covers the fundamental operations of a Singly Linked List in C.
It includes list creation, various insertion methods, deletion, and traversal.

## Operations and Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Description | Time Complexity |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| Creation | Allocating memory for a new node | O(1) |
| Traversal | Visiting each node in the list | O(n) |
| Insert at Beginning | Adding a node to the front | O(1) |
| Insert at End | Adding a node after the last element | O(n) |
| Insert in the Middle | Adding a node after a specific value | O(n) |
| Deletion | Removing a node by value | O(n) |

## How to Run

Compile the code:
```bash
gcc week3_linked_list.c -o week3
./week3
```
