# Week 06 – Circular Linked List Operations

## Course
CS1102 – Data Structures and Algorithms

## Assignment Description
This assignment demonstrates the implementation of a Circular Linked List in C. The program supports insertion at a specific position, deletion from a specific position, and traversal.

## Circular Linked List Description
A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. There is no NULL pointer at the end.

## Operations Implemented
1. Insertion at a specific position  
2. Deletion at a specific position  
3. Traversal of the list  

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C  
- Data Structure: Circular Linked List  

## Compilation and Execution
```bash
gcc week6_circular_linked_list.c -o week6
./week6
```
