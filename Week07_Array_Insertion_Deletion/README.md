# Week 07 – Array Insertion and Deletion

## Course
Data Structures 

## Assignment Description
This assignment implements basic insertion and deletion operations on a static array using the C programming language. The program demonstrates how elements are shifted to maintain array order after each operation.

## Operations Implemented
- Insertion of an element at a specified position  
- Deletion of an element from a specified position  
- Display of array elements  

## Algorithm Description
- **Insertion**: Elements are shifted one position to the right starting from the end of the array to create space for the new element.
- **Deletion**: Elements following the deleted element are shifted one position to the left.
- **Traversal**: The array is displayed sequentially.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C  
- Data Structure: Static Array  

## Compilation and Execution
```bash
gcc week7_array_insertion_deletion.c -o week7
./week7
```
